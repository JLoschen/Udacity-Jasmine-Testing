# Feed Reader Testing Project
This is a project for the Udacity [Front End Web developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). That is meant to get the student used to writing tests. It uses the javascript testing framework [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) which is meant to be an intuitive and readable framework. The assignment was to write tests for an RSS feed.

# How to run the tests
The tests run automatically when the web page is loaded so you can simply [download](https://github.com/JLoschen/Udacity-Jasmine-Testing/archive/master.zip)  the project and double click `index.html`.

Alternatively you can [view it](http://jloschen.github.io/JasmineTesting/index.html) on my github page. The tests that ran are shown at the bottom of the page. Passing tests are shown in green text.
